    Base class for all ``nn.Module`` to be used in the ``Agent``'s. It provides basic interface to get the value

    the way dataset is sliced by implementing ``dataset`` function that returns ``Dataset`` for example ``LSTM``
    implementations must return ``Dataset`` that returns sequences in each call to get item.

    For ``LSTM`` implementations the model should also heep track of the internal state of the ``LSTM`` cells.

    ``factory`` method is here jus to help keep static typing clean when constructing ``Agent`` objects and should
